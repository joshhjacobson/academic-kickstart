Probably Novel is the University of Colorado Boulder Applied Math department podcast. The podcast seeks to highlight undergraduate research across campus as well as provide inspiration and information on how to get involved with research early on.

As the founding members recently graduated, we are in transition phase, but will be releasing new episodes starting Fall 2018.
