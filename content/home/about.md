# Welcome

I am a Master's student in applied mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder where I'm engaged in the nexus of statistics, climate, and computer science. My thesis involves the development of a novel ensemble forecast verification metric for spatial calibration in precipitation fields, supervised by [Will Kleiber](http://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/kleiberw/).  I have also been involved with the [Kasprzyk Research Group](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/krg/) where I developed visualization software for multi-objective optimization problems. Upon graduation, I am preparing to pursue a PhD in statistics with environmental applications.

This summer, I've been modeling regional sea level rise projections for the 21st century as a Data Science Intern at [Jupiter Intelligence](https://jupiterintel.com/). On the weekends, you can find me skiing, mountain biking, or general thrill seeking somewhere in the Rocky Mountains.
