# Welcome

I am a fifth year Bachelor's/Master's student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder. My Master's thesis involves the development of a novel ensemble forecast verification metric for spatial calibration in precipitation fields, supervised by Professor [Will Kleiber](http://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/kleiberw/). This summer, I will be joining [Jupiter Intelligence](https://jupiterintel.com/) as a Data Science Intern. I have also been involved with the [Kasprzyk Research Group](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/krg/) where I developed visualization software for multiobjective optimization problems. Upon graduation, I plan to attend a PhD program in statistics or geography.
