# Welcome

I am a fourth year Bachelor's/Master's student in Applied Mathematics at the University of Colorado Boulder. I think an understanding of math is the foundation of impactful science as it is the language used to describe natural phenomena.

My Master's thesis involves the development of forecasting metrics using simulated random field realizations, supervised by Professor [Will Kleiber](http://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/kleiberw/). I am also a member of the [Kasprzyk Research Group](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/krg/) where I am developing visualization software for multiobjective optimization problems. Upon graduation, I plan to attend a graduate program in climate sciences.
